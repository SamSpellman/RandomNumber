# The first approach I will try is just the linear congruential generator.
# The coefficients are very important to get a statistically random 
# distribution, but I will not concern myself with this at the current moment.
# Function used:        X[n+1] = (aX[n] + c) % m

# This function will initialize the generator by calculating ten values

    # this will seed the generator and iterate to get it started

# param num is the last number that was calculated (or the first term)
